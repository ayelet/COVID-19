# COVID-19
Look for daily data on COVID cases around the world - User can choose which continent and what country data is displayed,
for each country - Total confirmed cases, number of critical conditions, number of deaths etc.
Button "Normalise" is used to present the data normalised to 10 million=> Instead of total cases, number of cases per 10 million
